      In Azure Cosmos DB SQL API accounts, there are two ways to read data:

      **Point reads** - You can do a key/value lookup on a single item ID and partition key. The item ID and partition key combination is the key and the item itself is the  value. For a 1 KB document, point reads typically cost 1 request unit with a latency under 10 ms. Point reads return a single item.

      **SQL queries** - You can query data by writing queries using the Structured Query Language (SQL) as a JSON query language. Queries always cost at least 2.3 request units and, in general, will have a higher and more variable latency than point reads. Queries can return many items.
